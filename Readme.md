# SPDEs bibliography maintained by [Le Chen](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~lzc0090/)

## The bib file: [All.bib](All.bib).

## Explanations
1. Most entries downloaded from [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet) to keep the
   records consistent.
2. The [BibTool](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtool?lang=en) is used to generate the citation keys.
3. All references are listed in [All.pdf](All.pdf), check [All.tex](All.tex) for the usage of biber
   to handle the bibliography.
4. There are about 2.6K entries so far.
5. How entries are selected? Here are some general three principles that have been used:
    1. All papers from some authors whose research interest is close to mine are included.
    2. References from some interesting papers, whenever there is a MR number, are included.
    3. References that I come across will be included.
6. [Sample setup using neovim](Sample_setup_using_neovim.md)
