# SPDEs bibliography maintained by [Le Chen](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~lzc0090/)

## Motivation

When writing a paper, it is not an easy task to keep the bibliography part correct and updated. This
process is also very time-consuming. Through this repo, we provide a uniform access to the latest
bibliography entries related to the research area of the author: _Stochastic Partial Differential
Equations (SPDEs)_.

* Similar auto completion function exists in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

## The bib file: [All.bib](All.bib).

* A GPT model was created to query the database on Nov. 12th 2023. The results are far from being usable, actually a little disappointed, but you can may some fun to play with it. Here is the [link](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7ILEucNag-spdes-bib).

## Explanations
1. Most entries downloaded from [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet) to keep the
   records consistent.
2. The [BibTool](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtool?lang=en) is used to generate the citation keys.
  * The convention is two last names separated with period and two digit for year surrounded by :,
      and the first word in the title. For example, `dalang:99:extending`.
3. All references are listed in [All.pdf](All.pdf), check [All.tex](All.tex) for the usage of biber
   to handle the bibliography.
4. There are about 2.6K entries so far.
5. How entries are selected? Here are some general three principles that have been used:
    1. All papers from some authors whose research interest is close to mine are included.
    2. References from some interesting papers, whenever there is a MR number, are included.
    3. References that I come across will be included.
6. [Sample setup using neovim](Sample_setup_using_neovim.md)
7. [All_Numbered pdf](All_Numbered.pdf) is generated by `bib2pdf All.bib All_Numbered.pdf`, where the list of references are listed by numbers.
