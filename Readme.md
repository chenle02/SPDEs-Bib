# SPDEs bibliography maintained by [Le Chen](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~lzc0090/)
#

## Motivation

When writing a paper, it is not an easy task to keep the bibliography part
correct and updated. This process is also very time-consuming. Through this
repo, we provide a uniform access to the latest bibliography entries related to
the research area of the author: _Stochastic Partial Differential Equations
(SPDEs)_ and related fields.

## Current Statistics

## Demo using nvim

* Similar auto completion function exists in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

## The bib file: [All.bib](All.bib).

* A GPT model was created to query the database on Nov. 12th 2023. The results are far from being usable, actually a little disappointed, but you can may some fun to play with it. Here is the [link](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7ILEucNag-spdes-bib).

## Explanations
1. Most entries downloaded from [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet) to keep the
   records consistent.
2. The [BibTool](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtool?lang=en) is used to generate the citation keys.
  * The convention is two last names separated with period and two digit for year surrounded by :,
      and the first word in the title. For example, `dalang:99:extending`.
3. All references are listed in [All.pdf](All.pdf), check [All.tex](All.tex) for the usage of biber
   to handle the bibliography.
4. How entries are selected? Here are some general three principles that have been used:
    1. All papers from some authors whose research interest is close to mine are included.
    2. References from some interesting papers, whenever there is a MR number, are included.
    3. References that we come across will be included.
5. [Sample setup using neovim](Sample_setup_using_neovim.md)
6. [All_Numbered pdf](All_Numbered.pdf) is generated by `bib2pdf All.bib All_Numbered.pdf`, where the list of references are listed by numbers.
7. More documentation will be added to the [wikipage](https://github.com/chenle02/SPDEs-Bib/wiki).
